## Part 1

This Ruby program uses the 'carl' hash and 'sagan' array to produce a single puts statement:

"We are a way for the cosmos to know itself."

## Part 2

Created an array of hashes named ‘ghosts’ to hold the following information:

Inky is 4 years old, loves reindeers and has 25 dollars in the bank.  
Pinky is 5 years old, loves garden tools and has 14 dollars in the bank.  
Blinky is 7 years old, loves ninjas and has 18.03 dollars in the bank.  
Clyde is 6 years old, loves yarn and has 0 dollars in the bank.

## Part 3

Wrote a script that uses the JSON provided by the dog.ceo API to print out a nicely formatted list of dog breeds and sub-breeds.  
Then replaced the last line of the script with a nested loop that prints out all the dog breeds and associated sub-breeds.

## Part 4

Using data from the city's open data set, figured out how many of our trees may die now that the Emerald Ash Borer has been found here.  
Then wrote a program to automatically count all the Ash trees in the dataset.
